Exploded View, the international project of UK-bred, Berlin-based Annika Henderson, and Mexico City-based Hugo Quezada (Robota) and Martin Thulin (Crocodiles), return with their second album Obey, which is set for release September 28th via Sacred Bones. The first single from the record "Raven Raven" is streaming online now.

Commenting on the hypotonic, spooky new single Exploded View said, “Ever felt like someone is watching your every move? Your every twitch, your every sneeze? Stare back into the face of observation. Never give in to external control. You can break this.”

Leaving behind their live recording process and now a tight three-piece, Exploded View strike a special balance between precise and wild, unshackled and grounded, groovy and unhinged. The have a knack for making the esoteric feel accessible and crafting pop music out of seemingly raw consciousness. This ability to make beautiful music that feels written beyond the veil is at the heart of what makes Exploded View so captivating, and it’s on full display all over Obey. Recorded in Mexico City, the album feels like a liberation of creative impulses and expression allowing the band to reach more mature sonic territories.
 
Obey flows like a dream sequence with the aptly titled “Lullaby” opening the album; it slowly lures the listener into a lucid state, preparing them for the journey to come. The ten apocalyptic, yet soothing songs encompass all the classic dream motifs: intrigue, danger, ecstasy, hard to place, yet primordial visions, and a constant sense of movement.

Full Biog:

Exploded View is a collaborative project helmed by the UK-born, Berlin-based political-journalist-turned-musician Anika   (Invada Records / Stones Throw). After playing a string of 2014 solo   shows in Mexico with a backing lineup composed of local producers  Martin  Thulin, Hugo Quezada and Amon Melgarejo, Anika and her new  bandmates  discovered a chemistry that they simply had to capture on  tape.

During  their rehearsals in Mexico City, the four musicians discovered  a new  sound, several steps removed from the krautrock-isms of Anika’s   previous work. The straight to tape sessions that followed in the San   Rafael neighborhood, ventured somewhere new; a lighter place,  unguarded,  veering from any script.  Improvisation was the guiding  principle and  the source of the band’s inspiration. The studio itself  was outfitted so  that every sound produced in the room would be  recorded. A Tascam 388  8-track captured everything – fully live, fully  improvised, first-takes  only. Produced by Thulin and Quezada and  mastered by Josh Bonati in NYC,  the long player is due out in August  2016.


‘No More Parties In The Attic’  is a song that finds  power in its conflict; a demented collage of  noisy perplexing tones and  ominous drones backed with distorted  guitars, a devastating bass line  and fractured rhythms. While Anika’s  jarring vocal display may appear  softer than her previous works, the  song is laced with her unmistakable  icy & nonchalant vocals  delivered in ruinous calm.
